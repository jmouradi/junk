A hodgepodge of whipped-together junk. 

## Talos

A script that uses DFS to play the puzzle game in The Talos Principle. See the
input direcotry to see how things work. The script is basically a more
imperative language like Go more or less directly translated into Python. There
is no SLA on this script and so it is _wildly_ inefficient. One input file 
takes on the order of tens of seconds.
