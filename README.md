A hodgepodge of whipped-together junk. 

## Talos

A script that uses DFS to play the puzzle game in The Talos Principle. See the
input direcotry to see how things work. The script is basically a more
imperative language like Go more or less directly translated into Python (I did
not even use docstrings). There is no SLA on this script and so it is _wildly_
inefficient. One of the input files takes on the order of tens of seconds.
